# 🌐🗣️ Language Translation Tool & 👁️‍🗨️🚗 Object Detection and Tracking

This repository houses code for two cool functionalities: a **Language Translation Tool** 🌐 and an **Object Detection and Tracking** module 👁️‍🗨️🚗.

## 🌐🗣️ Language Translation Tool

### ✨ Overview

The Language Translation Tool is a web app 💻 designed to translate text between different languages using smart machine translation and the Microsoft Translator API. This project shows how to use AI to break down language barriers and offer easy-to-use translation services.

### 🚀 Features

* **Text Translation:** Translate text across many languages. 🗣️↔️🌍
* **Source Language Detection:** Automatically figures out the original language or lets you pick it. 🤔➡️✅
* **Target Language Selection:** Choose the language you want the translation in. 🎯➡️🗣️
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and easy to use design. 😊👍
* **Built With:** Flask 🐍, Microsoft Translator API 🔑, Service for text translation 📝, HTML/CSS for the look and feel. 🎨

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

* Python 3.x 🐍
* Flask 🧪
* Microsoft Translator API Key 🔑 (Get one from the Azure portal!)
* Clone the repo:
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Aj2122003/Codealpha_Artificial-intelligence_Ajinkya.K.git](https://github.com/Aj2122003/Codealpha_Artificial-intelligence_Ajinkya.K.git)
    \`\`\`
    Go into the Language Translation Tool folder.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install -r Chatbot\ for\ FAQS_vs_code\ settings.json/requirements.txt  # Make sure this path is right!
    \`\`\`
    *(Note: Double-check the path to your `requirements.txt` file.)*

2.  **Set up API Key:**
    * Grab your Microsoft Translator API key from Azure. 🔑
    * Set it as an environment variable or directly in the code (be careful with this for security!). 🔒

3.  **Run the App:**
    \`\`\`bash
    python LTT_Task_app.py # Or whatever your main app file is called
    \`\`\`

4.  **Open in Browser:** Go to the address where the app is running (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000`). 🌐

## 👁️‍🗨️🚗 Object Detection and Tracking

This part has code for finding and tracking objects. More info about the specific models, methods, and how to use them can be found in the files here and maybe in a `README` inside the `Object detection and tracking_LICENSE` folder (if there is one!).

### 📂 Contents

* `ODT_yolo.ipynb`: Probably a Jupyter Notebook with code for object detection using YOLO or something similar. 📦
* `Object detection and tracking_LICENSE`: Might have license info and more details about the object detection and tracking stuff. 📜
* `Object detection and tracking_git attribute`: Settings for Git related to this folder. ⚙️

### ℹ️ More Info

For detailed instructions on using the object detection and tracking parts, check the comments in `ODT_yolo.ipynb` and any docs in the `Object detection and tracking_LICENSE` folder. 📖
